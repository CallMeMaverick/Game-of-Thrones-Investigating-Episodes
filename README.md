# ⚔️ Game of Thrones; Investigating Episodes ⚔️

#### After DataCamp Introductory courses
[DataCamp Project](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/08ac9c7a-ede5-40d4-9e0d-35f1b49a5361)

Little yet fascinating Data Science project where data about Game of Thrones episodes is being analyzed and visualized.

## 📚 Description

In this project, I have applied the skills I gained in "Introduction to Python" and "Intermediate Python" at DataCamp Career Track. The goal was to explore, analyze, and visualize Game of Thrones data (I'm a big fan), particularly data about episodes and their duration. Pandas, Matplotlit, and other entry-level material from the "Introduction to Python" course had been used.

This project has been aimed at consolidating my knowledge and getting a grasp of solving real-world data science problems.


## 🚀 Project Task
#### 1. Overall Episode Duration by Season
* Load data and inspect it
* Create a DataFrame with Durations
* Kinda "clean" data and get a convenient data format to work with
* Visualize data

#### 2. Visualizing Each Episode's Duration by Season
* Create a list containing sub-lists corresponding to a season
* Flatten durations (check code for details)
* Define colors for a scatter plot
* Create a scatter plot
